While the choice of prior can be subjective, it must be explicitly stated, making all assumptions transparent. This allows for an objective comparison of the different approaches.In fact, there are two common types of priors in least squares fitting.p_0(lambdamid x_i_i=1^N m) = 1, i.e. a uniform prior. Since one usually uses a computer, there is a largest number b infty and a smallest number a  -infty that the computer can use. Then one may choose the uniform distribution p_0(lambda mid x_i_i=1^N m) = frac1b-a. Sine the posterior probability is only considered up to proportionality, one can simply use p_0(lambdamid x_i_i=1^N m) = 1. This leads to a maximum likelihood objective.\nIn ill-defined problems, it is common practice to use some kind of regularization. In some cases, these regularizations correspond to certain priors. For example, the Tikhonov regularization essentially uses the prior p_0(lambdamid x_i_i=1^N m) propto exp(-Gamma lambda ^2).","category":"page"},{"location":"posterior_background/#Independent-data-points","page":"Background","title":"Independent data points","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"posterior_background/","page":"Background","title":"Background","text":"A common assumption is that the data points are independent.
